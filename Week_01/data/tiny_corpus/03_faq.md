## Technical Questions

### How does sync actually work?
CloudSync Pro uses delta-sync technology:
1. Monitors file changes in real-time
2. Calculates only the changed bytes (delta)
3. Encrypts and transmits just the delta
4. Merges changes on receiving devices
5. Resolves conflicts automatically or prompts user

### What happens if I edit a file offline?
Changes are queued locally and automatically synced when you reconnect. If someone else edited the same file, you'll see a conflict resolution dialog.

### How are conflicts resolved?
- **Automatic:** For non-overlapping changes in text files
- **Manual:** You choose to keep your version, their version, or merge
- **Version Branching:** Create separate versions instead of merging

### Is there a file size limit?
- Free: 100 MB per file
- Pro: 5 GB per file
- Business: 50 GB per file
- Enterprise: No limit

### How long are deleted files retained?
Deleted files remain in trash for 30 days before permanent deletion. Enterprise accounts can configure custom retention policies.

## Security & Privacy

### Where is my data stored?
Data centers in US (Virginia), EU (Ireland), and Asia (Singapore). You choose your primary region. Enterprise customers can use on-premise storage.

### Who can access my files?
Only you and people you explicitly share with. CloudSync Pro uses zero-knowledge encryption for enterprise accounts, meaning even we cannot access your data.

### What encryption do you use?

- **Zero-Knowledge:** Optional for enterprise (client-side encryption)
